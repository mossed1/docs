# Testing and First Run
Once you've assembled your TARS and installed the necessary software, it is time to run the program.

<Steps>
### SSH
First, connect to your RPI using SSH.

### Run Script

Run the script in the TARS-AI folder using:
```bash
python App-Start.py
```

If your LCD screen is displaying booting logs... 

The first boot will take some time to download all the required models.

Congratulations! Your TARS-AI is now assembled, connected, and ready for development.
