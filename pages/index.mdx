We're engineering the fastest practical path to general purpose and scalable robotics for everyone.

### Our Robots
**Zeroth-01** is an open-source [end-to-end](/ml/rl) humanoid robot starting at $350 with vision, RL-based walking, and speech.

### Our Approach
- **Sim2Real** transfer with open-source robot and simulation environment.
- **End-to-End** control with deep RL.
- **VLA**: Vision-language-action for generalizable policies.
- **Affordability**: We're making our robot more affordable with open-source hardware and software.
