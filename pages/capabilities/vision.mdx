# Vision

Zero-01 platform has a 1080p camera mounted on the head of the robot.

## Video Streaming
OpenLCH SDK provides a function to start video streaming from the robot.

```bash
openlch start-video-stream
openlch get-video-stream-urls
```

Currently, the video stream is available over RTSP, HLS, MSE and WebRTC.

## Image Processing and Object Detection

Neural acceleration is available via CVITEK's NPU. Here is a list of models tested by manufacturer:
