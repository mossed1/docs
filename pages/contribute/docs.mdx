# Contributing to Documentation

## Overview

Our documentation is written in MDX (Markdown + JSX) and uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) as the documentation framework. The documentation source files are hosted on GitHub at [TARS-AI-Community/docs](https://github.com/TARS-AI-Community/docs).

## Getting Started

1. Follow the general [contribution guidelines](/contribute/guidelines) to fork and clone the docs repository.
2. Make sure you have `node` installed. If you do not have it installed, install it at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Make sure you have `pnpm` installed. If you do not have it installed, install it using:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:   
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized as follows:

- `pages/` - Contains all documentation pages
  - `_meta.tsx` - Defines the navigation structure
  - `index.mdx` - Home page
  - Other directories contain section-specific content

## Writing Guidelines

### File Format
- Use `.mdx` extension for documentation files
- Place images in the `public/` directory
- Use relative links for internal navigation

### Markdown Features
- Use headings appropriately (H1 for page title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Use callouts for important information
- Add images with captions when helpful

### Components
We provide several built-in components:
- `<Callout>` for important notes
- `<Steps>` for step-by-step instructions
- `<Tabs>` for organizing related content
- `<Image>` for responsive images

Example:
```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  Important information goes here
</Callout>
```

## Testing Changes

1. Preview your changes locally using `pnpm dev`
2. Check that:
   - All links work
   - Images display correctly
   - Code blocks are properly formatted
   - Navigation structure is correct

## Contributing to the BoM

### Adding New Items

To add a new item to the Bill of Materials:

1. Add the item to `lib/productLinks.ts`:

```typescript
export const productLinks: Record<string, ProductLink> = {
  // ... existing items ...
  "new-product-id": {
    id: "new-product-id",
    name: "Product Name",
    countryLinks: {
    "US": "https://www.example.com/product-us",
    // Add more country-specific links as available
    },
    defaultLink: "https://www.example.com/product-us" // Usually the US link
  },
};
```

2. Add the item to the BoM table in `pages/build/bom.mdx`:
```mdx
<Tr>
  <Td>Product Name</Td>
  <Td>Product description</Td>
  <Td>1</Td>
  <Td><CountryLink productId="new-product-id">Buy</CountryLink></Td>
</Tr>
```

### Adding Country-Specific Links

To add links for your country to existing items:

1. Find the item in `lib/productLinks.ts`
2. Add your country's link to the `countryLinks` object. You can find your country's code (i.e. "GB" for Great Britain) under `lib/countries.ts`.
```typescript
"raspberry-pi-5": {
  id: "raspberry-pi-5",
  name: "Raspberry Pi 5",
  countryLinks: {
  "US": "https://www.amazon.com/...",
  "GB": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/...", // Add your country
  "DE": "https://www.amazon.de/..." // Add your country
  },
  defaultLink: "https://www.amazon.com/..."
},
```
